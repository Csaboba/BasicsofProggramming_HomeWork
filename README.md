This is my first software that I had to do as homework during my Basics of Programming 1 course.

The software is a simple library console application which stores books and information about them (author, title, year of release etc.).
You can use it by writing the desired action's number into the console. It has only a few commands: you can list all of the books, search for a specific book or books, add or delete a book.
Altough not very complicated, I am proud of this program, because it works well and has almost no flaws. Also, while making it, I learned a lot about how to make a well-structured program.
